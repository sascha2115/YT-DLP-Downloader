# no venv activation required, works from any shell.
#
# The bundle ships no .git, so it cannot run "git rev-parse" at runtime. Stamp
# the commit into BUILD_COMMIT and bundle it with assets/; the app reads it
# through resource_path() and shows it in the output-panel header. Without this
# the packaged app would report a version with no commit.
