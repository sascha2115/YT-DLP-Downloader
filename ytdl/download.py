        start_download()'s prelude has set base_filename/output_dir and after
        the info fetch has filled video_id/site/url. `fetch` exists for
        tests: video_id -> (segments, error).

        Multiple early returns are deliberate guard clauses: site not
        supported, missing video ID, missing title, no matching segments,
        fetch failure, write failure — each returns a distinct tri-state.

        Segment source:
          1. sb_bar.segments — check_sponsorblock() fetched ALL categories
             for the visual bar during the info fetch, so normally zero HTTP
             here.
          2. A fresh API fetch when the bar is empty (bar cleared, or the
             info fetch's lookup failed).

        Returns the applied segments (like create_edl_file()), [] when there
        is deliberately nothing to write (no matching segments), or None on a
        failure — in every no-file case a line says why on the output panel.
