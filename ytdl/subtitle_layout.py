"""Subtitle display layout: turn ASR cues into what a viewer should read.

Pure logic - no Qt, no filesystem. One stage lives here, a module-level
function, so the behaviour can be tested without the app (see
temp/test_subtitle_rolling.py and the seven real captures
temp/subtitle-capture-*.srt).

  rolling_cues() - groups the ASR's own windows in twos, one window per line,
                   so two caption lines show at once exactly as the YouTube
                   player shows them - shown whole instead of rolling in word
                   by word. Nothing is repeated and nothing is re-cut.

Why the ASR file needs no re-packing: the captions already ARE the display.
Each window is a short phrase, every window overlaps the next, and the file has
no line breaks at all - the two lines a viewer sees are two consecutive
windows. So this module groups those windows in twos and changes nothing else.

A sentence-aware layout stage (re-pack the words so cues end at sentence ends,
with durations from a reading-speed model) shipped as 1.4.0-1.4.1 and was
removed in 1.4.3, together with the `subtitle_words_per_cue` preference that
drove it: nothing called either once the paired-window layout took over. It is
in git history if it is ever wanted back - `git show 349d0eb` is the last state
that had it.

# Rolling layout: the YouTube player's own look.
#
# The ASR file is already the display, and it needs only one change: pairing.
# Each window is a short phrase, every window overlaps the next (100% of pairs on
# the real captures, median 1.6s), and the downloaded file has NO line breaks at
# all (0 of 2398 cues across seven captures) - because in the YouTube player the
# two lines a viewer sees are two consecutive windows, the finished one on top
# and the next one rolling in underneath.
#
# So the display is rebuilt by grouping the windows in twos: two consecutive
# ASR windows become one two-line cue, shown whole. Nothing is repeated - each
# window appears exactly once, on the line it occupies in the player:
#
#     SET 1   the Peruvian skulls and                  <- window 1
#             No, before I thought Oh, go ahead.       <- window 2
#     SET 2   Sorry.                                   <- window 3
#             No, go ahead.                            <- window 4
#
# A cue starts at its FIRST window's own timestamp - verbatim from the source
# file, not an interpolated word time and not delayed for reading speed - so the
# top line appears exactly when YouTube's would. It ends where the NEXT set
# starts, which is that set's first window, so cues never overlap and the screen
# changes at a moment the ASR itself marks.
#
# No reading-speed model is involved: durations are the ASR's own gaps, so a fast
# speaker gets short cues and a real pause stays blank - the same trade the
# player makes.
#
# Each window's text is written verbatim on its own line - NEVER re-wrapped. A
# long window stays a long line, exactly as YouTube shows it; a player that wants
# to fit it wraps it itself, and second-guessing that here would make the file
# differ from the captions for no gain.
